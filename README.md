# ai-for-aw research assisant
A gAI-based chatbot for exploring the ancient world. The first code cell of the notebook ('ancient_world_research_assistant.ipynb') is set up for use in Google Colab. But it should be easy to adapt for local use on your own machine. Installing huggingface_hub and gradio may be all that you need. And I suggest commenting out the "!pip..." line as there's no need to execute that everytime you run the cell.
