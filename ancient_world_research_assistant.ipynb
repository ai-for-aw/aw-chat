It is not a perfect tool as there will still be errors of fact and analysis in the text it produces. Revealing those errors is a goal in that their occurence is an opportunity to think about how the output can be improved.\n",

Much of the ability to affect the responses you get comes from expanding and using the \"Additional Inputs\" section that appears below the example prompts.\n",
